How create-react-app works
==============================
When we run create-react-app <project_name> , then it install bunch of dependencies =>
1.React => The react lib
2.Webpack => The module bundler and loader
3.Babel => Turns Es6,7 and JSX into ES5 code
4.Jest =>Automated test runner

npm run test =>
- Jest test runner starts up
- Jest finds all files ending with .test.js      and execute test inside them.
- Jest prints out results of tests to the        terminal
- Jest waits for a file to change , then runs    all tests again
